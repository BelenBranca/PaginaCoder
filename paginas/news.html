            <h3>Emily Ratajkowski Presents</h3>
            <h4>The Perfect White Sneaker</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="textoNoticia1">
            <p>“I’m actually becoming kind of an anti-heel person,” model turned actress and author Emily Ratajkowski says. “I feel more comfortable and like myself in sneakers.” For those who are also feeling the itch to ditch their heels, good news: Ratajkowski’s new Superga collaboration will make it that much easier.

            A longtime fan of the brand’s classic 2750 tennis shoe, the street style icon found the collaboration to be a natural fit. 
                
            Of the design process, Ratajkowski says, “I love mood boarding and creating things, but I’d never designed a sneaker before, so I wasn’t coming in and being like, ‘let’s completely rework Superga.’” 
            “There was a real moment, like four years ago, where it was fun for me to wear very out-there sneakers, but what I really want now is something classic,” she explains. “I think that we’re going through this very confusing time in fashion. I personally have recently decided to give up on all of that and just wear what I want to wear rather than following the trends that come and go.”

            <h3>You Can Wear Zara’s New Collection</h3> <h4>Inside and Outside of the Metaverse</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="textoNoticia2">
            <p>We are living in a world where what we look like online is becoming just as important as our IRL appearance. Which explains why retailers like Zara are leaning into the phenom to make sure we can fully express ourselves, even in the metaverse. In a first-of-its-kind release, the fast-fashion retailer debuted a “Metacollection” called Lime Glam, and it’s filled with eight designs perfect for spring dressing in reality or Zepeto’s virtual playground.

            Now, the stylish inhabitants can add to their 3-D closets pieces from Zara. From the towering hot pink platform sandals to the slinky ruched satin dresses, the limited-edition capsule collection is a showcase of the season’s biggest going-out trends. The roster also includes pared-back casual essentials—like a distressed denim jacket, cutoff shorts, and woven tote bags. We don’t know which we like better: the actual citrusy green scrunched slip dress or the digital version. Thankfully, you don’t have to choose.
            And the digital-meets-physical creations don’t just stop at clothes. Zara also created beauty products to be enjoyed in both realms—because no human or avatar should have to go without nail polish.
